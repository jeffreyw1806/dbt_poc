      1. To clone tables in both a table list and schema(s), such as common and netowrk, for the tables been loaded in these 2 schemas in the past 7 days,
         run a command like this:
         dbt run-operation clone_prod_tables --args "{'table_list':'stage_awsuser.seed_clone_table_list','schema_name':'common,network','days_look_back':'7'}" --target pre_prod  
      2. To clone tables only in table list, you can run a command like this:
         dbt run-operation clone_prod_tables --args "{'table_list':'stage_awsuser.seed_clone_table_list'}" --target pre_prod  
      3. To clone tables in a single schema, such as the common schema, that have been loaded in produciton in the past 2 days, run this command:
         dbt run-operation clone_prod_tables --args "{'schema_name':'common','days_look_back':'2'}" --target pre_prod
